Goal of Day1 is to generate a Band Name.
I learned abot printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation and variables.

Parenthesis indicates the begining and ending of the string.
We can use both single and double quotes to print things.
To move to new line : \n
# is used for commenting.

Rules for variable naming:
1. Make code readable.(keep names that makes sense)
2. No space between seperate words.(Use underscore)
3. No number at the begining of the word.
Don't use previleged words like print, input etc.
