Goal of Day 4 is to create Rock, Paper, and Scissors game.
I learned about Randomisation and python lists.
=> askpython.com is the best website to learn about python.

random.randint(a,b) => Generates random numbers between a and b. (Including both od them([a,b]))
random.random() => Gives floating point numbers from 0.0 to 0.9999.. i.e, [0,1)

Lists:
-> We can store any datatype.
-> Supports both positive and negative indexing.
-> To modify a value inside list; use list[0] = 'apple'
list.append(): Adds a value at last of the list.
To append a list at the end of list, use extend: list.extend(['apple','banana'])
->We can have list inside list.
