Goal of Day 3 is to code a way to treasure island.
I learned about conditional statements, logical operators, codeblocks and scope.

To print multiple block string at a time, use three single quotes.
    Ex: print(''' ***Matter*** ''')
'\' is used as a escape character.

*** Code for leap year***
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
