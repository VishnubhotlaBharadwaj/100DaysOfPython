Goal of Day 2 is to generate a tip calculator.
I learned about Datatypes, numbers, operations, Type conversion, f-strings.

Subscripting: Pulling out a particular character from a string.
        print("Hello"[0]) = H

To write a very bog number, we use commas like 123,456,789.
But, in programming language, we can use underscores. 123_456_789. Both are same.

To check type of a variable, use type()
To convert a string into int, wrap it with int()
Division always outputs a float value.
To round a number use round(). To round to two numbers, use round( ,2)
// : 8//3 = 2 => This is for floor division. Always outputs an integer value.

f-string syntax: print(f" Your name is {name}")
