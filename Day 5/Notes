Goal of Day 5 is to create a Password Generator program.
I learned about python loops.

=> Indentation is very important in for loop.
=> Python has inbuilt functions for almost everything.. like sum(), len(), max(), min(), ....

for num in range(a,b): => prints from a to b-1.
for num in range(a,b,2): => starts from a, skips 2 values each and ends at b-1.

=> random.choice() gives a random number from list.
=> random.shuffle(), shuffles the given list in a random manner.oa
