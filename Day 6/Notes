Goal of Day 6 isto instruct the karel to do a randomly generated maze.
I learnt about code blocks, indentation, while loops and functions.

for step in range(6) => executes the loop 6 times.

for loop is very good for iteration cases.
While loop is used, to carry some sort of functionality or to check condition.
